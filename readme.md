## Development

This project is open to anyone who wants to contribute, large or small! Whether you noticed a typo or want to add a
whole new feature, go for it!

Large additions should be discussed in issues or on Discord first. If you're new to Javascript and Python, ask me on Discord for where to start and you can use CJ as a starting point for a contribution.
